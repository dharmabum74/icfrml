# icfrml
A flexible open-source schema supporting a top-down approach to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). This repository captures entity-level assessments (COSO), financial statement risks, controls, control testing, deficiencies, remediation, and Information Used in the Control (IUC). Designed to unify compliance data, reference authoritative frameworks, and integrate seamlessly with AI-based automation.

I'm working on this as an exercise, with the overarching purpose of having Norman Marks notice it and call it stupid.
