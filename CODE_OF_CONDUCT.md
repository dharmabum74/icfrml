# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose
We aim to create an open and inclusive community for everyone contributing to or using this project. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as steps to report unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior
- **Be Respectful**: Use welcoming and inclusive language. Critique ideas, not people.
- **Be Considerate**: Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Be Collaborative**: Share knowledge, help others, and create a friendly environment.
- **Use Constructive Feedback**: Offer suggestions kindly, and accept feedback gracefully.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or inflammatory language directed toward an individual or group.
- Personal insults, threats, or overly aggressive language.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Reporting and Enforcement
If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:
1. **Contact the Maintainers**: Reach out via [email@example.com] or open a private issue if available.
2. Provide details: Who was involved, what happened, when and where it occurred.
   
The maintainers will review and investigate all good-faith reports. We will respond in a way that we deem appropriate based on the circumstances. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the maintainers may take action up to and including temporary or permanent suspension from this project.

## 5. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (e.g., issues, pull requests, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## 6. Acknowledgments
